# 1 - Fundamental Concepts

- In a nutshell, **_Machine Learning_** is a set of tools and techniques that transform data into predictions or decisions (which we hope to be good) through tasks such as **_classification_**, **_regression_**, and **_clustering_**, among others. These techniques enable computers to learn patterns and relationships in data without being explicitly programmed, improving their performance on a specific task as they are exposed to more examples.

## Classification

Classification is a fundamental task in Machine Learning, where the objective is to assign a label or category to an input example based on its features. It's a type of supervised learning, which means that the model learns from a dataset with labeled examples, where each example has a known label or category.

The classification process generally follows these steps:

1. Data collection and preparation: Gather a labeled dataset, where each example has a feature vector and a corresponding label. Split the data into training and test sets.
2. Algorithm choice: Select a classification algorithm suitable for the problem, such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines (SVM), or Artificial Neural Networks.
3. Model training: Feed the training set to the chosen algorithm so it can learn the patterns and relationships between the features and labels. The model adjusts its internal parameters to minimize classification error.
4. Model evaluation: Use the test set to evaluate the performance of the trained model. Common metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. Model tuning: If necessary, adjust the model's hyperparameters or try different algorithms to improve performance.
6. Inference: Once the model is trained and validated, it can be used to make predictions (classify) new, unlabeled examples.

Some examples of classification problems include:

- Classifying emails as spam or not spam
- Medical diagnosis based on symptoms and tests
- Recognition of handwritten digits
- Sentiment analysis in product reviews

Classification can be binary (two classes) or multiclass (three or more classes), and some algorithms also support multi-label classification, where an example can belong to multiple classes simultaneously.
