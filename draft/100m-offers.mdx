## The secret to sales

- Make people an offer so good they would feel stupid saying no.

## What is an offer?

The only way to conduct business is through a value exchange, a trade of dollars for value. The offer is what initiates this trade.

## Pricing

What does it take to grow? Just three simple things:

1. Get more customers
2. Increase their average purchase value
3. Get them to buy more times

That's it.

### What is a Grand Slam Offer

It's an offer you present to the marketplace that cannot be compared to any other product or service available, combining an attractive promotion, an unmatchable value proposition, a premium price, and an unbeatable guarantee with a money model (payment terms) that allows you to get paid to get new customers... forever removing the cash constraint on business growth.

In other words, it allows you to sell in a "category of one", or, to apply another great phrase, to "sell in a vacuum." The resulting purchasing decision for the prospect is now between your product and nothing. So you can sell at whatever price you get the prospect to perceive, not in comparison to anything else.

### Pricing: Finding the right market - A starving crowd

I have a saying I use to train sales teams "The pain is the pitch." If you can articulate the pain a prospect is feeling accurately, they will almost always buy what you are offering. A prospect must have a painful problem for us to solve and charge money for our solution.

The purpose of this chapter is to reinforce two things.

1. First, don't pick a bad market. Normal markets are fine. Great markets are great.
2. Second, once you pick, commit to it until you figure it out.

If you try one hundred offers, I promise you will succeed. Most people never try anything. Others fail once, then give up. It takes resilience to succeed. Stop personalizing! It's not about you! If your offer doesn't work, it doesn't mean you suck. It means your offer sucks. Big difference. You only suck if you stop trying. So, try again. You'll never become world class if you stop after a failed attempt.

### Pricing: Charge what it's worth

#### Price to Value Discrepancy

In order to understand how to make a compelling offer, you must understand value.

The reason people buy anything is to get a deal. They believe what they are getting (VALUE) is worth more than what they are giving in exchange for it (PRICE).

The moment the value they receive dips below what they are paying, they stop buying from you. This price to value discrepancy is what vou need to avoid at all costs.

After all, as Warren Buffet said, "Price is what you pay. Value is what you get."

- We are not trying to get the most customers. We are tying to make the most money.

##### Virtuous Cycle of Price

Those who pay the most, pay the most attention.

Charge a premium. It will allow you to do things no one else can to make your clients successful.

"We were able to charge a premium because we provided more value than anyone else in the industry. In a real way, we were charging on a fraction of what our clients made using our system."

**This is important. Our clients still got a deal. The gap between what they paid (price) and what they got (value) was massive. As a result, the virtuous cycle continued to spin. We charged the most money. We provided the most value.**

## Value - Create your offer

### Value offer: The value equation

You need to have a big discrepancy between what something costs you and what you charge for it. It is the only way to be unreasonably successful.

Many entrepreneurs believe that charging "too much' is bad. The reality is that, yes, you should never charge more than your product is worth. But you should charge far more for your product and services than it costs to fulfill it. Think up to a hundred times more, not just two or three times more. And if you provide enough value, it should still always be a steal for the prospect. That is the power of value. It unleashes unlimited pricing and profit power to scale your company.
